calendar.template and calendar.css are designed to help you to use this template with
createcal.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. Copy calendar.template into the htmlTemplates subdirectory of the course web,
replacing the default calendar.template there.

2. Run createcal as normal to generate calendar.html.

3. Remove or rename schedule/index.html, then recreate it as a symlink to calendar.html
   ln -s ../calendar.html index.html

Now you may update/regenerate the calendar as normal.
